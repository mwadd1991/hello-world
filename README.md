# hello-world

hello there

I am a security guard which sounds dreadfully boring, but luckily I work at a brand new Children's Hospital. 
I have had the oppurtunity to be involved in developing and implementing new emergency response frameworks on the security        side and I enjoy my work. I do know that I can not be a security guard forever, and am looking to learn a trade that will      allow growth, and a chance to thank and plan instead of react. Hence, programming!!!! yay!!!!
